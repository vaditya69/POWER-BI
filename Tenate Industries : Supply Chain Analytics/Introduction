Tenate Industries, a prodigious manufacturer of industrial pizza-oven components, recently experienced a sudden shift in demand after a viral trend affected projected production volumes. 
As a Supply Chain Analyst, I conducted a data-driven Make vs Buy analysis to support strategic decision-making and cost optimization.

This project required evaluating core cost concepts—unit cost, extended cost, non-recurring expenses (NRE), and full cost—to understand the true financial impact of each option. 
Using structured data tables from suppliers and internal teams, I built a clear cost framework that highlighted why full cost analysis is essential for accurate operational decisions.

On the Make side, I assessed internal cost estimates, equipment capacity, and incremental investment requirements, focusing only on costs directly impacted by the decision. 
This included analyzing raw material, labor, and energy costs, and identifying when additional equipment or resources would be required due to increased production volume.

By synthesizing these insights into a clear, comparative cost model, I delivered actionable recommendations that strengthened Tenate Industries’ operational efficiency, 
cost visibility, and supply chain resilience.
