Project Overview:
Minor_Project_1: Concurrently, performed in-depth EDA on Airbnb and Glassdoor datasets using Python via DataCamp. Cleaned data by identifying and imputing null values with median replacement and handled outliers through IQR analysis and Winsorization. Explored categorical variables (e.g., job roles, gender) using box plots and column charts, and analyzed continuous variables using scatter plots and correlation analysis to extract meaningful business insights.

Minor_Project_2: Developed and implemented advanced data analysis solutions by combining Power BI DAX techniques with exploratory data analysis (EDA). In Power BI, utilized logical functions (e.g., HASONEVALUE, SWITCH, RELATED) for dynamic measure creation, employee performance categorization, and sales segmentation. Implemented Row-Level Security (RLS) to enable region-specific data access and resolved data context issues via bidirectional relationships. Created calculated tables using SUMMARIZE and ADDCOLUMNS, and applied time intelligence functions (TOTALYTD, SAMEPERIODLASTYEAR) for year-over-year sales analysis and trend insights.
