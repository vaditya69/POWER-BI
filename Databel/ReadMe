Hello Everyone My name is Aditya :)
In this project, I have applied business analytics to study customer churn at Databel, focusing on identifying the key reasons why customers leave 
and proposing actionable solutions to address the problem. Using Power BI, I built an interactive dashboard that provides insights into churn patterns, 
highlights critical factors influencing customer decisions, and uncovers areas for improvement. The project also discusses the challenges faced during the analysis,
the reasoning behind the methods used, and concludes with practical strategies Databel can adopt to reduce churn and improve overall customer retention.
