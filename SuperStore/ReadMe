I have created an MYSQL Script where I tried getting the insights of a database which I have downloaded online. Some of the questions which I thought that would be necessary to look upon and take actions accordingly. After that I have created and Power BI dashboard where I am visualizing the data for a better visual understanding. Below will be the link to the project and any recommendations for upgrading the level of project/ or any other insights which you might thing would be useful to get are apricated.
