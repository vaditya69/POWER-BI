Project Announcement: Power BI Sales & Profit Analysis Dashboard
I’m excited to share my latest Business Analyst project — a refined, insights-driven, and professionally developed version of an earlier analysis using the Super Store US dataset.
Since enrolling in DataCamp, I’ve deepened my expertise in data storytelling, data modeling, and data visualization using industry-standard tools. Their in-depth training on Power BI, SQL, and analytical thinking has significantly contributed to my growth in the analytics field.
This project showcases key business intelligence (BI) competencies such as data extraction, KPI tracking, performance measurement, and the creation of an interactive, decision-support dashboard.

Project Overview

Data Exploration & EDA: 
Performed thorough exploratory data analysis to understand the structure and quality of the dataset.
Identified and handled missing values, duplicates, and data inconsistencies.
Used EDA techniques to uncover initial patterns, distributions, and potential outliers prior to modeling and visualization.
Ensured a clean and reliable dataset using data cleansing, normalization, and validation checks.

Demographic Analysis:
Conducted geographical segmentation to evaluate sales and profit by region and state.

Identified target markets and performance gaps using visual analytics.

Sales & Profit Analysis:
Performed profitability analysis and sales trend evaluation.

Used categorical data segmentation to uncover high-performing customer segments.

Time Series Analysis: 
Identified seasonal patterns, trends, and anomalies in sales data.

Applied temporal analysis techniques for weekly and monthly performance evaluation.

Custom DAX Measures: 
Built calculated measures for:
 • Sales & Profit Contribution % 
 • Month-over-Month (MoM) Sales & Profit Change
 • Churn and Retention Correlation

Churn & Retention Metrics: 
Measured customer churn rate and retention performance
Assessed customer lifetime value (CLV) drivers and business impact

SQL Integration:
Connected to MySQL Server and executed SQL queries for data extraction

Derived key insights such as:
 • Churn & retention rate tables
 • State-wise shipping mode effectiveness and profitability

Interactive Features in Power BI
Implemented interactive dashboards using:
 • Bookmarks for narrative-driven analysis
 • Custom Tooltips for contextual information
 • Play Axis to animate data changes in scatter plots

Tooltips used across various pages for enhanced user experience (UX):
  Order ID by Product Category (Others Page)
  Profit by Customer Segment (Sales & Profit Page)
  Sales by Day of the Week (Time Series Page)
  "Others" Page Highlights
